•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional by executing the script multiple times. I ensure that it is secure by locking down my files and saving them in a trusted folder. I also create a backup in a separate folder in case the original gets corrupted or if i mess up the currently working code by adding a new class or variables.


•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by ensuring that I have all their requirements and conditions in the code base. I will also ask questions or make suggestions to reinforce my understanding in their requirements and either adjust or create new requirements to meet their needs. 


•	How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with a simplistic mindset. I read their requirements and start by making a layout of what they want their system to do, then I fill in any blanks by asking questions or by seeing whether I’m creating code for an epic or just a single function.
